## 📐 5. DAX Queries

**1. Age Group Calculated Column**
```DAX
AgeGroup = SWITCH(
    TRUE(),
    'public cust_detail'[customer_age] < 30, "20-30",
    'public cust_detail'[customer_age] >= 30 && 'public cust_detail'[customer_age] < 40, "30-40",
    'public cust_detail'[customer_age] >= 40 && 'public cust_detail'[customer_age] < 50, "40-50",
    'public cust_detail'[customer_age] >= 50 && 'public cust_detail'[customer_age] < 60, "50-60",
    'public cust_detail'[customer_age] >= 60, "60+",
    "unknown"
)

**2. Income Group Calculated Column
```DAX
IncomeGroup = SWITCH(
    TRUE(),
    'public cust_detail'[income] < 35000, "Low",
    'public cust_detail'[income] >= 35000 && 'public cust_detail'[income] <70000, "Med",
    'public cust_detail'[income] >= 70000, "High",
    "unknown"
)

3. Week Number Calculated Column
```DAX
week_num2 = WEEKNUM('public cc_detail'[week_start_date])

4. Revenue Calculated Column
```DAX
Revenue = 'public cc_detail'[annual_fees] + 'public cc_detail'[total_trans_amt] + 'public cc_detail'[interest_earned]

5. Current Week Revenue Measure
```DAX
Current_week_revenue = CALCULATE(
    SUM(credit_card[Revenue]),
    FILTER(ALL(credit_card), credit_card[Week_num2] = MAX(credit_card[Week_num2]))
)

6. Previous Week Revenue Measure
```DAX
Previous_week_revenue = CALCULATE(
    SUM(credit_card[Revenue]),
    FILTER(ALL(credit_card), credit_card[Week_num2] = MAX(credit_card[Week_num2])-1)
)

7. WoW Revenue Ratio Measure
```DAX
wow_revenue_ratio = DIVIDE(
    (credit_card[Current_week_revenue] - credit_card[Previous_week_revenue]),
    credit_card[Previous_week_revenue]
)

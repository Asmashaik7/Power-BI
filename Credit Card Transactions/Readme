Tables size & type:
Customer table- 10,293 rows * 17 columns
Credit-card table- 10,293 rows * 20 columns

4. Steps worked:
Data cleaning & preprocessing.
Exploratory data analysis (EDA).
DAX queries, Calculated columns created.
SQL queries used in files uploaded in folder.
Power BI dashboard creation.
Key insights found.

DAX Queries
1.Calculated column
AgeGroup = SWITCH(
TRUE(),
'public cust_detail'[customer_age] < 30, "20-30",
'public cust_detail'[customer_age] >= 30 && 'public cust_detail'[customer_age] < 40, "30-40",
'public cust_detail'[customer_age] >= 40 && 'public cust_detail'[customer_age] < 50, "40-50",
'public cust_detail'[customer_age] >= 50 && 'public cust_detail'[customer_age] < 60, "50-60",
'public cust_detail'[customer_age] >= 60, "60+",
"unknown"
)

2.Calculated column
IncomeGroup = SWITCH(
TRUE(),
'public cust_detail'[income] < 35000, "Low",
'public cust_detail'[income] >= 35000 && 'public cust_detail'[income] <70000, "Med",
'public cust_detail'[income] >= 70000, "High",
"unknown"
)

3. Calculated column: week_num2 = WEEKNUM('public cc_detail'[week_start_date])

4. Calculated column: Revenue = 'public cc_detail'[annual_fees] + 'public cc_detail'[total_trans_amt] + 'public cc_detail'[interest_earned]

5. Measure: Current_week_revenue = CALCULATE(
      SUM(credit_card[Revenue]),
      FILTER(
          ALL(credit_card),
          credit_card[Week_num2]=MAX(credit_card[Week_num2])))

6 Measure: Previous_week_revenue = CALCULATE(
    SUM(credit_card[Revenue]),
    FILTER(
        ALL(credit_card),
        credit_card[Week_num2]=MAX(credit_card[Week_num2])-1))

7. Measure: wow revenue ratio = DIVIDE((credit_card[Current_week_revenue]-credit_card[Previous_week_revenue]), credit_card[Previous_week_revenue])
